# Project 06 – Breadth First Search (BFS) Traversal

## Overview
This project demonstrates the **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** algorithm using two different implementations:
1. A simple **non-class version** (without queue structure)
2. A **class-based version** that uses a queue list for traversal.

BFS is a fundamental graph traversal algorithm that explores all neighbors of a node before moving to the next level.

## Part 1 – BFS Without Class (Simple Implementation)

### Description
This version uses a simple list to store nodes to be visited.  
Nodes are added and removed from the list using `.append()` and `.pop(0)`.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
