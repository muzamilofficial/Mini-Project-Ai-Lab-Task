## Overview
This project contains two small Python programs designed to improve logic building and problem-solving using loops, conditionals, and lists.

## Part 1 – FizzBuzz Game

### Description
This program generates random numbers and adds them with the previous number.  
Based on the total, the user must correctly input one of the following:
- `fizz` → if the total is divisible by 3 only  
- `buzz` → if the total is divisible by 5 only  
- `fizzbuzz` → if divisible by both 3 and 5  
- `nmbr` → if divisible by neither  

Any wrong input ends the game.

### Key Concepts
- Random number generation  
- Loops and conditionals  
- Modulus operator for divisibility checking  
- Basic input validation

## Part 2 – Movie Budget Analyzer

### Description
This program stores a list of movies and their budgets, allows the user to add new ones, and then calculates:
- Total movie budget  
- Average movie budget  
- Which movies have budgets higher than the average and by how much  

### Key Concepts
- Lists and tuples  
- Loops and user input  
- Sum, average, and conditional comparisons
